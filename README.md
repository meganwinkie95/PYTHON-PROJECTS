# PYTHON PROJECTS
 
This directory contains simple python projects.
They range from small functions to fully functional databases.

Django-University is a project that creates a form to enter class information and campus information into a fully functioning data base.
The database saves these entries and when prompted returns the requested information.





Feel free to take a look
