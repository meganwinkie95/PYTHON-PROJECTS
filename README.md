# PYTHON PROJECTS
 
This directory contains simple python projects.
They range from small functions to fully functional databases.

DjangoUniversity is a project that creates a form to enter class information and campus information into a fully functioning data base.
The database saves these entries and when prompted returns the requested information.

Django_CheckBook_Project is a backend and frontend project that revolves around a pretend bank website. This project allows the user to create a new bank account,
add deposits and make withdrawls. The system has multiple pages that link to one another to create a dynamic pseudo-website that tracks and returns the users inputed data.

Other projects included in this directory are simple functions that display an understanding of the python language
